    Setup:
    You have to install tesseract OCR: https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.2.0.20220712.exe
    What does it do?:
    It queues up, sells all carousel units, recognizes when augments are on screen
    --> reads them and sends them to a database. --> repeat
    
    Step 1: Choose a normal Map - with no animations or anything else!
    Step 2: Make sure your settings are:
    Fullscreen mode (Windowed-Fullscreen should work too)
    resolution: 1920x1080 (other might not work!)
    Also: Put the game on your main screen.
    Step 3: Go up on PBE and click on TFT -> 1v0 Mode -> confirm.
    From now on the Bot should do all on 
    itself. It just has to see the "Find Game" Button.
    
    Reminder: Please do not interrupt with the Bot... 
    I tried to make sure that you can use your Pc most of the time,
    but it may cause errors
    or it could be stuck in a loop and won't continue. So best case -
    use it if you don't use your Mouse or PC at all.
    If the program has no respone - don't worry, it still works!!
    To close it, just close the CMD.
    
    PS: Start as admin!!!
    
    Last Step: Please enter your username below,
    for database purposes.
